# Count down timer challenge - ReactJS

This code challenge allows you to choose your own path and lets you flaunt your creative panache and technical skills along the way. Get as much completed as you can, with the focus on functionality over design (AS ALWAYS, YOU ARE A DEVELOPER, NOT A DESIGNER...).

In a fictional world, we need to create a simple countdown timer that looks like this:.

|Days  |Hours  |Minutes |Seconds|

|77    | 23    | 59     | 59    |

Base Requirements:
- A clean modern look
- Clean, readable, maintainable codebase
- Source code on Github or Bitbucket
- Cross browser support (or graceful degradation)
- Responsive design and implementation (DO NOT USE A CSS FRAMEWORK, JUST YOUR CSS)
- A good user experience
- Service hosted on [https://jaimeabm.github.io/react-challenge-countdown-timer/](https://jaimeabm.github.io/react-challenge-countdown-timer/) (.github.io address)
-  Webpack 3.x
-  NodeJS

To run the project in your machine, just run the following command from the main folder:

`
npm install
`
