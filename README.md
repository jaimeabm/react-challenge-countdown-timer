# CountDown Timer Challenge - ReactJS

This code challenge allows you to choose your own path and lets you flaunt your creative panache and technical skills along the way. Get as much completed as you can, with the focus on functionality over design (AS ALWAYS, YOU ARE A DEVELOPER, NOT A DESIGNER...).

In a fictional world, we need to create a simple countdown timer that looks like this:.

|Days  |Hours  |Minutes |Seconds|
|77    | 23    | 59     | 59    |
